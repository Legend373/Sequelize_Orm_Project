#This project is an e-commerce application built with **Node.js, Express, Sequelize, and PostgreSQL**.
It provides a backend API to manage **users, products, carts, and orders** with authentication and secure data handling. 
The API follows the **ACID principles** on the database to ensure data consistency, reliability, and integrity, 
while supporting migrations for schema updates and model relationships such as associating products with carts.

Here is a postman endpoint test exploration link of the project
